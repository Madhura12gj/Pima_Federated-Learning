# Federated-Learning
Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning technique that trains an algorithm across multiple decentralized edge devices or servers holding local data samples, without exchanging their data samples. In simpler terms, this technique trains the ML model on the place where data resides. For more details check this [link.](https://federated.withgoogle.com/)
# Advantages
FL helps in privacy preservation of the data. This technique mainly involves privacy preservation techniques such as Homomorphic ENcryption, Secured Multi Party Computation (SMPC) and Differential Privacy.
# Pima_Federated learning
This repository will help you to understand how FL on the Pima Diabetic Dataset. It involves the use of OpenMined tool called Pysyft and Pytorch for implementation.
